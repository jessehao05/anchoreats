# AnchorEats

Website that provides several helpful Vanderbilt dining features for Vanderbilt students.

**Why?** Near the end of the semester, I was getting tired of calculating the number of days and doing the math to find out how many meal swipes I needed to use. I noticed several of my friends mentioned doing these calculations as well, so I wanted to make a tool to make doing the math faster. As for the Taste of Nashville map, there were many times during the school year where I wanted to eat out instead of going to a dining hall, but I was unfamiliar with the eligible meal money restaurants. I wished that there was a tool or map that allowed me to see only Taste of Nashville restaurants and also showed the closest restaurants to my location.

## Features

- Meal swipe calculator: calculate how many swipes needed to use each daily until the end of the semester to get to 0 (taking into account breaks & Farmers' Market)
- Map showing all Taste of Nashville Restaurants + current location
- Search Taste of Nashville restaurants by name or description
- Find the 5 closest Taste of Nashville restaurants to the current location
